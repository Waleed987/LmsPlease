# Privacy Policy for NustFlow

**Last Updated:** January 27, 2026

## 1. Data Collection and Usage
NustFlow ("the Extension") collects specifically the following user data:
- **Authentication Information:** Usernames and passwords for NUST LMS (`lms.nust.edu.pk`) and Qalam (`qalam.nust.edu.pk`).

**How we use this data:**
This data is used **solely** for the functionality of the Extension—specifically, to automatically fill in the login forms on the respective NUST portals. This provides the "auto-login" feature.

## 2. Data Storage
All authentication information is **stored locally** on your device using the Chrome Storage API (`chrome.storage.local`).
- Your passwords are **encrypted** using AES-GCM encryption before being saved to local storage.
- The encryption keys are generated and stored locally on your device.

## 3. Data Sharing
**We do not share your data.**
- The Extension **does not** transmit your credentials or any other personal data to any external servers, third-party analytics services, or the developer.
- All data remains strictly within your local browser environment.

## 4. User Control
You have full control over your data:
- You can **view** and **update** your stored credentials at any time via the Extension's popup interface.
- You can **permanently delete** all stored data by clicking the "Clear" button in the Extension or by uninstalling the Extension.

## 5. Contact
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact the developer via the GitHub repository issues page.
